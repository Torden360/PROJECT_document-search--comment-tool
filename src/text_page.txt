Hey there,
Here's a plain text page for you to read in and search then comment on. Today is nice and sunny, but last week was cold and dreary. 

Weather in San Francisco

Normally it is cold at night, but because yesterday was sunny, it was kind of warm. Therefore, tonight may also be warm. 

Thank you for listening!


Hey, have you ever been to Chicago? Neither have I. I hear it is quite windy there. Oh, boy!
It's still quite windy in SF. There is also fog.
